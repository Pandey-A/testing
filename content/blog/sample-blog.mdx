# How to Write Effective Blog Posts

Welcome to this comprehensive guide on writing blog posts for the GDG website. This sample post will demonstrate all available formatting options and components.

## Introduction

Writing technical blog posts is an excellent way to share knowledge and establish yourself as an expert in your field. This guide will show you how to format your content effectively.

### File Structure

When adding new blog posts, add the markdown file to the `content/blog` directory.
You can include images in the `content/blog-images` directory or link to image.

At the start of your markdown file, include the metadata block with the title, description, date, author, and image.
sample-blog.mdx
```markdown
---
title: "your title"
description: "description"
date: "2025-03-20"
author: "Annalhq Shaikh"
image: "/blog-images/your-image.jpg" 
---
```
Alternatively, you can also link to an external image like `image: "https://example.com/your-image.jpg".`
### Basic Text Formatting

You can use **bold text** using `** your text **` for emphasis or *italics* for slight emphasis. You can also use ~~strikethrough~~ when needed.

#### Lists and Organization

Here's how to create different types of lists:

* Unordered list item 1
* Unordered list item 2
  * Nested item 2.1
  * Nested item 2.2
* Unordered list item 3

For sequential instructions, numbered lists work well:

1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step
   1. Sub-step 3.1
   2. Sub-step 3.2

## Code Examples

### Inline Code

Use `inline code` for variable names, short commands, or file paths.

### Code Blocks

```javascript
// A JavaScript example
function sayHello(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  return true;
}

// Call the function
sayHello('GDG Member');
```

```python
def calculate_factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * calculate_factorial(n-1)
        
print(calculate_factorial(5))  # Output: 120
```

## Images and Media

### Adding Images

> Blockquotes are perfect for highlighting important information or quotes from speakers.
>
> They can span multiple paragraphs and help break up your content visually.

## Horizontal Rules

Use horizontal rules to separate sections:
